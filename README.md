# ‚ö° FastCalc: A Fast Arithmetic Engine Using C + Python

**FastCalc** is a beginner-friendly yet powerful project that connects **Python with C** using the `ctypes` module.  
It acts like a mini version of how **NumPy**, **PyTorch**, and other high-performance libraries speed up Python code using C under the hood.

> üß† I built this to **understand how C functions can be used inside Python** for speed ‚Äî just like real libraries do.

---

## üì¶ What This Project Does

- Handles **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**
- Takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input
- Uses **C** for fast backend arithmetic
- Uses **Python** for user-friendly input/output
- Supports **floating-point numbers** (like `3.3`, `5.5`)
- Works in **Linux** and **Windows (via WSL or MinGW)**

---

## ü§î Why I Built It ‚Äî Motivation

> Libraries like **NumPy**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow** use C/C++ for their performance-critical code.  
> I wanted to **learn how this performance bridge works** by building a basic version myself ‚Äî where Python imports a `.so` (Linux) or `.dll` (Windows) and calls native C functions.

This project helped me understand:

- ‚úÖ How to write C functions for speed  
- ‚úÖ How to load compiled C code into Python using `ctypes`  
- ‚úÖ How real-world libraries connect low-level and high-level logic

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project (Linux / Windows)

### üêß Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)

#### Step 1: Install Requirements

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential python3
````

On Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc python3
```

#### Step 2: Compile the C Code

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o calc.so calc.c
```

#### Step 3: Run the Python File

```bash
python3 main.py
```

---

### ü™ü Windows (Using MinGW)

#### Step 1: Install Tools

* [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org)
* [Install MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

#### Step 2: Compile `calc.c` into DLL

```bash
gcc -shared -o calc.dll -Wl,--out-implib,libcalc.a calc.c
```

#### Step 3: Modify `main.py` for Windows

Replace:

```python
from ctypes import CDLL
lib = CDLL('./calc.so')
```

With:

```python
from ctypes import WinDLL
lib = WinDLL('./calc.dll')
```

#### Step 4: Run the Python File

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## üß† Limitations (for now)

* üö´ No error handling for divide-by-zero (returns 0 silently)
* üö´ No support for complex expressions like `a + b * c` (just two numbers)
* üö´ CLI-only (no GUI or web app ‚Äî yet!)
